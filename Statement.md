# Statement of Project

## Project Title
**Study Buddy – Flashcards, Quiz & Planner Application**

## Course
CSE1021 – Introduction to Problem Solving & Programming  
VIT Bhopal University

## Problem Statement
Students often struggle to revise concepts effectively due to a lack of simple, distraction‑free learning tools. Existing applications are usually too complex or not tailored for quick academic revision.  
There is a need for an easy‑to‑use Python-based tool to help students revise using flashcards, practice quizzes, and maintain study tasks.

## Objective
To design and implement a Python program that allows students to:
- Create and manage flashcards  
- Take randomized quizzes and receive instant scoring  
- Maintain a study planner with task management  
- Save all progress using persistent file handling  

## Scope
This project consists of three modules:
1. **Flashcards Module** – Create & manage flashcards for each subject  
2. **Quiz Module** – Generate quizzes, evaluate answers, export results  
3. **Planner Module** – Add, list, mark, and delete tasks  

## Software Requirements
- Python 3.8+  
- VS Code  
- Tkinter (for GUI support)

## Hardware Requirements
Any system capable of running Python.
